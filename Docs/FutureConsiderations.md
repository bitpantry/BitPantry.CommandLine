## Future Considerations
Currently, there are several common command line features that are not implemented in this solution, but may be in the future.

- Ordinal arguments
- Mutually exclusive arguments
- Switch arguments
- Repeating arguments *(an ```ICollection``` argument may work for many repeating argument use cases - see [argument value parsing](Commands.md#argument-value-parsing))*
